"""TokenVerifier port — edge auth.

Validates an inbound `Authorization: Bearer <token>` against a
configured identity provider and resolves the calling principal.

`TokenVerifier` is the hexagonal port; two adapters implement it:

  - `JwtTokenVerifier`     — local JWKS-based JWT verify (RFC 9068).
                        Industry IdPs that issue JWTs (Microsoft Entra,
                        Google, Auth0, Okta, AWS Cognito, Helmholtz
                        AAI, ORCID-via-OIDC) plug into this path.
  - `IntrospectionTokenVerifier` — RFC 7662 token introspection. Required
                        for Globus Auth (opaque-by-default) and any
                        future IdP that doesn't issue JWTs. Also the
                        revocation-strong path for cases where a
                        compromised JWT must be invalidated before
                        its `exp` ticks past.

Both adapters return the same `VerifiedPrincipal` shape so the
downstream call path (FastAPI middleware → `request.state.principal`
→ `get_principal_id` resolver → handler.authorize) is verifier-
agnostic.

## Adapter selection

The `IdentityProviderRegistry` (`cora.infrastructure.auth.idp_registry`)
owns the per-issuer adapter mapping at process startup. The HTTP/MCP
middleware does NOT make the adapter choice per request — it always
asks the registry, which routes by either:

  - JWT shape detection (3 dot-separated base64 chunks) + unverified
    `iss` claim peek → matching `JwtTokenVerifier`.
  - Otherwise → the deployment's configured `IntrospectionTokenVerifier`.

## Why a port, not a function

Two production adapters today; rule-of-three would trigger an
extraction. We're at two because Globus + non-Globus IdPs are
operationally distinct paths. Unit tests use a local fake implementing
`verify` (see tests/unit/auth/test_bearer_auth_middleware.py), so the
port stays testable without an IdP round-trip.
The Protocol shape lets the kernel hold a `TokenVerifier` field
without leaking which adapter implementation; same architectural
move as `Authorize` (AllowAllAuthorize for tests / TrustAuthorize
for production).

## Errors

`InvalidTokenError` (→ HTTP 401 by the route layer) is the
catch-all for "the token failed verification" — bad signature,
expired, wrong audience, wrong issuer, malformed structure. Carries
a short machine-readable `reason` so logs distinguish modes without
leaking IdP details to the client.

`IntrospectionUnavailableError` (→ HTTP 503) is the introspection-
specific failure when the IdP can't be reached or returns 5xx. The
JWT path can't raise this (local verify, no network). Distinct from
`InvalidTokenError` so operators distinguish "your token is bad"
from "our upstream is down."

## What is NOT here

- The Authorize port stays unchanged — it already takes
  `principal_id: UUID`. `TokenVerifier.verify` returns the principal,
  Authorize gates the call.
- No session / cookie / CSRF concerns — CORA is stateless bearer.
- No OAuth client flows — CORA is a Resource Server (RS); the
  client obtains the token from the IdP and brings it. WI11 captures
  the trigger for revisiting OAuth-client capability.

    `subject` is the raw `sub` claim string from the token, kept for
